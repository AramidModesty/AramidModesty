- Hello. I'm Aramid Monsalve.
- I'm a studend of technology in software developing at ITM from colombia.
- As a Java/Python developer, you can ask me the doubts you have. But know that I'm only at my
  third semester, and that I am a spanish speaker so I may don't fully understand calls yet.
- My code is of free use unless that it is specified in the licence, though if you use full libraries or a full code from me,
  I would appreciate that you leave the credits.
- I'm also an independent pianist beginner, my channel have the same name of Aramid Monsalve on youtube if you would like to see.
- And that's all, nice to meet you.
