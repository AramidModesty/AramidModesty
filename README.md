- Hello. I'm Aramid Monsalve, who can be refered as Aramid Modesty only as name for this account persona.
- I'm a student of technology in "Tecnología en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones para Dispositivos Móviles" at ITM from Colombia.
- As a Java, Python, and most recently c++ developer, you can ask me the doubts you have. But know that I'm only at my
  fourth semester, and that I am a Spanish speaker who is not really used to speak so don't expect me to speak without stuttering or speaking a bit loud.
- My code is of free use unless that it is specified in the license, though if you use full libraries or a full code from me,
  I would appreciate that you leave me and the ones that appear the credits inside your own credits.
- I'm also an independent pianist beginner, my channel have the same name of Aramid Monsalve on YouTube if you would like to see.
- And that's all, nice to meet you.
